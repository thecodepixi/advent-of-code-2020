# Advent of Code 2020

This year I'll be doing Advent of Code in some weird combination of JavaScript/TypeScript and Ruby. I might try to take a whack at some Java but depends on how I feel about _things_. Most of these will be very very bad.

## My Solutions:

- [Day 1](d-1/index.js)
- [Day 2](d-2/index.js)
- [Day 3](d-3/index.js)
